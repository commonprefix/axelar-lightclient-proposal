    blockchain since the early days of ICO boom.
\end{itemize}

This project will be executed in multiple phases, described in detail below.

\subsection{Phase 1: Architectural Design}
During this phase, we will study the Axelar codebase in depth and propose a suitable architecture, consisting of a Go Cosmos module that will implement the on-chain Ethereum light client.
Our approach will stick to the following principles: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Respectful of previous work.} Our proposed architecture will require minimal changes to the codebase, maintaining the existing design choices of the codebase.
  \item \textbf{Extensibility.} The architecture will allow extending the light client to different source chains in the future, beyond Ethereum.
  \item \textbf{Modularitity.} The architecture will be modular, in a way that allows upgrading to a different proof mechanism (e.g., SPV or ZK) and makes the protocol future-proof.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Deliverables.} At the conclusion of this phase, we will deliver the following items:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A detailed design document, that describes the architecture of the light client to be implemented on Axelar. The design document will detail the different components that we will develop. These include the Go module which will run within the Axelar codebase (acting as the verifier), as well as the modifications needed on the attestor codebase (also part of the full node), so that attestations can be reported to the on-chain verifier.
\end{itemize}

The document will be delivered in LaTeX PDF format and include pseudocode for the relevant components, so that their role is clear from a theoretical point of view.

\subsection{Phase 2: Consensus Validation}

During this phase, we will implement the consensus components of the on-chain light client. The implementation will be based on the outcome of Phase $1$. Based on our current understanding of the Axelar architecture, during the consensus implementation phase we will implement the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item verification of the Ethereum sync committee \emph{handover signatures}, including aggregate signature verification and quorum logic;
    \item verification of latest finalized block using sync committee signatures and Ethereum finalization logic.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Deliverables.} At the conclusion of this phase, we will deliver the following items:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A Cosmos Go module, which implements the consensus components of the on-chain Ethereum light client.
    \item A test suite, which verifies the correctness of the consensus components.
    \item A component that allows any friendly-but-untrusted party to submit to the on-chain verifier the consensus attestation data (sync committee signatures and block headers), produced via the Ethereum Beacon chain API.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 3: Execution Validation}
% TODO(shresth): High level description of this phase

This phase consists of implementing the execution logic of the on-chain Ethereum light client, responsible for checking EVM-related data (such as Ethereum transactions and events). In particular, we will implement the verification of Ethereum execution data, given a validated finalized Ethereum block. This includes the verification of transactions and events and checking the validity of the Merkle proofs for transactions and/or events as needed.

\noindent
\textbf{Deliverables.} At the conclusion of this phase, we will deliver the following items:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An extension of the Go Cosmos module (developed during Phase $2$), that implements the execution components of the on-chain Ethereum light client.
    \item A test suite that verifies the correctness of the execution components of the Go module.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 4: Theory, Deployment \& Audit}

During this phase, we will formalize the light client's construction and prove its security guarantees in a formal and rigorous manner.

We will also deploy the light client on Axelar's testnet and hand over the codebase with documentation to the Axelar team. We expect the Axelar team to conduct an audit of the codebase, before deploying it to the mainnet.

During this phase, we will help the Axelar team with the audit process and fix any issues that arise.

\noindent
\textbf{Deliverables.} At the conclusion of this phase, we will deliver the following items:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Testnet deployment of the Ethereum light client to the Axelar network (Lisbon).
  \item Handover of the codebase to the Axelar team with proper documentation.
  \item A LaTeX document that formalizes the light client construction and proves its security guarantees.
  \item Any fixes to the codebase that may be required as a result of an audit by the Axelar team.
\end{itemize}
