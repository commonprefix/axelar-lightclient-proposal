We work with industry partners who are looking to advance the state-of-the-art

from first principles, with provable security in mind.

Our consulting and audits pertain to theoretical cryptographic
protocol analyses as well as the pragmatic auditing of implementations
in both core consensus technologies and application layer smart contracts.
