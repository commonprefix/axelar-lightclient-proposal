\section{Construction \& Implementation Details}
In this section we would like to discuss the construction and implementation details 
of the suggested SPV style sync committee based light client. Note that the details of 
the contruction are not final and are subject to change. The Implementation will take 
place in form of a Go cosmos module. On a high level the new construction would work as
follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A user initiates the transactions by sending a transaction to a designated smart
  contract on the Ethereum chain, similar to the existing construction.
  \item A user then submits a request on the Axelar network with the corresponding ethereum
  transaction hash.
  \item Axelar attestors then querry the full node to check if the transaction is finalized
  and if so, they generate a light client proof. The proof has two components, a consensus 
  verification proof and an execution verification proof. The proof is then submited on-chain.
  \item The proof is then verified on-chain by the Axelar network. If the proof is valid, the
  transaction is executed on the Axelar chain.
\end{enumerate}
There will be two main components of the module, Consensus Verification and Execution Verification.

\subsection{Consensus Verification}
This component is responsible for generating and verifying the consensus verification proof.
The consensus proofs mainly constitue of aggregate sync committee signatures. This module is 
responsible for keeping track of the latest finalized block and the latest sync committee.
Their are two main consensus proofs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Update Latest Sync Committee.} This proof allows for updating the sync committee
  from one period to the next. This proof can be generated using beacon chain api 
  /eth/v1/beacon/light\_client/updates
  endpoint. The verification of the proof mainly involves checking the BLS aggregate signature of the
  sync committee and the Merkle inclusion proof of the next sync committee to the signed header.
  \item \textbf{Update Latest Finalized Block} This proof allows for updating the latest finalized
  block. This proof can be generated using beacon chain api /eth/v1/beacon/light\_client/finality\_update
  endpoint. The verification of the proof mainly involves checking the BLS aggregate signatures of the
  latest sync committee on the latest finalized block.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Execution Verification}
This component is responsible for generating and verifying the execution verification proof. For the sake 
of this grant we will only verify if a transaction is included in a block or a certain event was released 
from by a smart contract. The execution proof mainly constitute of a Merkle inclusion proof of the inerested 
transaction or event to the finalized block header recieved from the consensus verification component. The 
proof can be generated by fetching the complete block with all the transactions and events and then generating 
the Merkle inclusion proof. The verification of the proof is a Merkle inclusion check.
