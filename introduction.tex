\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Current Construction}

    - voting between attesters
        - attestors vote on txs happened on Ethereum
        - quadratic voting
    - assumptions:
        - eth safety/liveness
        - axelar validators 
        - axelar attesters 
        - quadratic assumptions 
        - power table assumptions 
\subsection{Problem Statement}
- ethereum to axelar
\subsection{Preliminaries}
- safety under dishonest majority in axelar network
- healing 
- incentives
