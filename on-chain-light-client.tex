\subsection{Merits of an On-Chain Light Client}
- safety under dishonest majority in axelar network\
- healing\
- incentives 

\subsection{On-Chain Light Client Alternatives}
\subsubsection{SPV Light Client (sampling validators)}
\subsubsection{SPV Light Client (sync committee)} 
        - 24kb 
        - a sampling of validators vs sync committee
\subsubsection{Optimistic Light Client}
        - doesn't make sense due to high bridge traffic
\subsubsection{Bisection Light Client}
        - doesn't make sense due to high bridge traffic
\subsubsection{SNARK Light Client}
        - recursion is not helpful
        - groth16: 2 group elements
        - plonk
        - holo2
        -
\subsubsection{Nice table with a comparison}
         - accountability
         - interactivity
         - proof size 
         - safety assumptions
             - eth safety/liveness
             - axelar validators 
             - axelar attesters 
         - liveness assumptions
         - historical validity
         - implementation complexity
